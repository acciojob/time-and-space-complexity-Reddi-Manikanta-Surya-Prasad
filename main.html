	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. 
        Efficient algorithms are designed to minimize time complexity to handle large datasets effectively.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. 
        For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) requires memory proportional to the size of the input.</p>
